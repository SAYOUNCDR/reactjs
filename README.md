# 📘 My React Learning Journey

This repository documents my self-paced deep dive into modern React development — including the core library, ecosystem tools, and real-world practices. It's designed as a personal learning map to track what I've learned and apply it to projects.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master React fundamentals and hooks
- Learn TypeScript and integrate it with React
- Understand and apply modern state management tools
- Build scalable UI systems and reusable components
- Explore design patterns and advanced architecture
- Test React applications with confidence
- Build fullstack projects with a modern frontend stack
